# Embryo-image-Prediction-And-Grading
🧬 AI-Powered Embryo Image Prediction for IVF Success 👶

📚 Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning to predict embryo viability and improve IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) success rates. Using advanced CNN models, the system classifies embryo images to assist embryologists in selecting the most viable embryos, reducing interobserver variability and enhancing overall ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) outcomes.

🎯 Objective
Increase IVF Success Rate: Improve embryo selection accuracy to maximize ART success.

Reduce Interobserver Variability: Ensure consistent embryo grading through AI automation.

Minimize Outcome Delays: Provide real-time predictions to reduce processing time.

📊 Dataset Information
Source: Embryo image dataset from IVF clinics and open-source repositories.

Key Features:

Time-Lapse Embryo Images

Embryo Quality Annotations (Grades)

Outcome Labels (Success/Failure)

🧠 Project Workflow
